        <p>As a former automotive journalist, making the career pivot into software engineering by joining General Assembly&apos;s three&#45;month intensive bootcamp felt like a pretty logical step. </p>
        <p>Not only am I at home working to tight deadlines, I also bring with me a skill-set that prioritises research, collaboration, relationship building and critical thinking in both a logical and creative sense.</p>
        <p>I have a keen appetite for acquiring knowledge and a desire to learn a new set of hard skills in a field I find extremely fascinating&#59; this is ultimately what spurred me on to make the jump. Now that I&apos;m here the almost unlimited scope for further learning and development really excites me. I want to build cool stuff with all of these newly&#45;acquired skills&#33;</p>
        <p>I&apos;m looking for opportunities as a software engineer or full&#45;stack developer that will allow me to hone and deploy my skills, and to learn from new teammates who bring a wealth of experience from the field to the table.</p>
